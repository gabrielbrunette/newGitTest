In 2009, i sold all my possession and bought a one way ticket to Mexico. Little did I know that for the next 6 years i’d be living out of a backpack, jumping from a relationship to another, until I got married and divorced, and then more jumping around. That I’d ended meeting and talking care of some of the world most influential people. A few people told me they would of never had the balls to do it, to be honest I was just as scared as anyone else. But my fear of living a meaningless and boring life far overcame my fear of the unknown. I would learned latter that far from being from being something to be scared of, I would thrive on the unknown, propelling me to new heights. The cold October weather, no sun light, a meaningless low self esteem and the fact that I had know idea how to talk to women, even less how to satisfied them. I felt at the time, as I should, that I had very little to offer them. Depress, shy, incapable of talking to girls, dispirited by higher education, I decided I had enough, something had to change. After faking being confident, faking being someone I was not just because I thought it would be more appealing to others… I believed at the time, and still entertain the thought the days, that the school system is very poor environnement to learn. Being fascinated by pretty much everything, I had started and abandoned bachelor degrees in economy, architecture, environnemental sciences and businesses administration. Why you might ask, simply because I felt I was learning nothing and if I ever wanted to learn anything they were teaching I could just read the school book by myself… sure I would not get a shiny diploma to show my parents bu I would learn the exact same thing none the less. I figured real learning had to happen in the real world. Wanna learn languages, anthropology, architecture, wold economy, world politics, geography, go travel the world and live what you want to learn. It is with this belief that I would learn to become a man, even if I sill feel like a kid inside. I learned  Spanish and Portuguese, how to invest in such a way that in a few year my student loan, which I used to invest in the stock market, would be turned into a nice pilled of money, how to satisfied a women sexually, how to talk myself into a three way, why dating two girl at the same time is a plan for disaster, how empty inside inside you feel after having sex didn’t connect with, the pleasures of drugs, the pleasure and downsides of burning the candle at both ends, the ups and downs of marriage that ends in a spectacular manner, the ups and downs of starting a business, getting screwed by your best friend, your employees, your partners…
